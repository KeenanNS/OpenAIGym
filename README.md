### Introduction

- In this task we have to balance a rod on top of a cart. Number of action spaces is 2. Action space is discrete here.
- **`0`** - move cart to the left
- **`1`** - move cart to the right

- I solved this problem using DQN in around 60 episodes. Following is a graph of score vs episodes.

### Introduction

- In this task we have to balance the pendulam upside down. Number of action spaces is 1 which is torque applied on the joint. Action space is continuous here.
- **`0`** - torque [-2, 2]

- I solved this problem using DDPG in around 100 episodes. Following is a graph of score vs episodes.
